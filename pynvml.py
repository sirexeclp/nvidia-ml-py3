"""
The NVIDIA Management Library (NVML) is a C-based programmatic interface for monitoring
and managing various states within NVIDIA Tesla™ GPUs.
It is intended to be a platform for building 3rd party applications,
and is also the underlying library for the NVIDIA-supported nvidia-smi tool.
NVML is thread-safe so it is safe to make simultaneous NVML calls from multiple threads.
